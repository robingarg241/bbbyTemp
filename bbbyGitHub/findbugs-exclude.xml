    <!-- Reason: Component models use the postConstruct() method for field initialization. However, findbugs only
        recognizes constructor calls, resulting in false positives. -->

    </Match>
    <!-- Reason: This is a questionable rule that is susceptible to false positives. Two classes in two completely
        different packages should be allowed to have the same method. Example: getURL() vs getUrl() -->

        <Bug pattern="NM_CONFUSING"/>
    </Match>
    <!-- Reason: Using default locale for toUpper/LowerCase() is fine in 99.99% of cases. -->

    <!-- Reason: Has a high chance of hitting false-positive. -->

        SERVLET RULES

    <!-- Reason: The requirements that servlets be serializable is a legacy Java feature that AEM does not use.
        There is no need to enforce serializable requirements. -->

        <Bug pattern="SE_BAD_FIELD,SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID"/>
    </Match>
    <!-- Reason: OSGi wires up fields in activate methods. This means even though the field is effectively 'final' it
        cannot be declared as such. -->
    <Match>
        <Bug pattern="MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD"/>
    </Match>
    <!-- Reason: OSGi services are injected into fields. This means we need to have instance fields on servlets. -->
